## Resources

Brastlewark uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - It's a free open source JavaScript compiler, and a configurable transpiler used in web development.
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org) - A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io) - It's a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - Group JavaScript files for use in a browser, but it is also capable of transforming, grouping or packaging almost any resource or asset.

And of course Adevinta Frontend itself is open source with a public repository on GitHub.
